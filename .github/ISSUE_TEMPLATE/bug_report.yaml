        ### STOP! Before continuing:
        - Please try searching for [existing reports](https://github.com/linuxmint/pix/issues?q=is%3Aissue+state%3Aall) that may match the behavior you're seeing. *If you find one, add to that issue, instead of opening a new one*. Include any relevant details that may differ from the original author's.
        - Run pix from a terminal to see if any errors or warnings are printed while reproducing the issue: `pix`
        - Check your logs - there may be some obvious cause for your trouble - in Linux Mint you can check ~/.xsession-errors (a hidden file in your Home folder).
        - If this is a *crash*, provide information about it if possible (CoreDump file, stack trace, etc...). In Linux Mint you can check the System Reports program.
